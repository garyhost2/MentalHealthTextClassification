# MindScope: Early Detection of Mental Health Issues from Text

## Overview
**MindScope** is a text classification solution developed for a private hackathon open to all participants. In an era where millions share their mental health struggles online, early detection through natural language processing can be vital in providing timely support. This project builds a machine learning model that categorizes textual content into mental health-related topics such as **depression**, **anxiety**, and **relationship-related issues**.

The challenge is organized by:
- **IEEE ENSI Student Branch**  
  *Founded in October 2011, the branch promotes engineering, computer science, and IT innovation through lectures and articles.*
- **IEEE ENSI SB-Computational Intelligence Society**  
  *Created in May 2021, this society focuses on advancing computing knowledge by introducing innovative techniques and sharing expertise.*

## Detailed Documentation

### 1. Problem Statement & Objectives
The hackathon challenge focuses on:
- **Objective:** Building a model to accurately classify text into mental health categories.
- **Significance:** Early detection of mental health issues can facilitate prompt interventions, potentially saving lives.
- **Evaluation Metric:** **Accuracy** – The model’s performance is measured by how accurately it classifies the text.

### 2. Data & Submission Format
- **Input Data:**  
  The dataset comprises rows with an **ID** and the associated text content. Each row is an individual sample.
  
- **Expected Output:**  
  A submission file (CSV) with the following format:
